Hello, welcome to my homepage! 

My name is Daksh, and I am a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research (MPIP) in Mainz, working under the supervision of Prof. Katharina Landfester. I am currently in the final stage of my doctoral studies and will soon be defending my thesis.

My research focuses on automating Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM) imaging using deep learning. As part of this work, I have submitted a patent application in collaboration with Max Planck Innovations. 
For more details about my research, please visit my research interest{:target="_blank"} or Google Scholar{:target="_blank"} page.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.



Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
